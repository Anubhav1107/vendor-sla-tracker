We faced a issue where various third party that we integrated with doesn't maintain their own sla.
During billing, we didn't keep count and time of it.
So, making a tool where you annotate over the third party api's, write their mock api(business or network)

So if that api ever sent a 500 eror, we will start the tracker and end when Either via our cron that api is on, or we got a success from that api.

Just started, will appreciate help, criticism
